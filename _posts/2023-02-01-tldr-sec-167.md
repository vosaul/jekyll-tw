Hey there,

I hope you've been doing well!

## Come say "How ya?" at OWASP Dublin

If you're going to be attending OWASP Global AppSec in Dublin, you can hang out
with some of my cool colleagues!

Fall in love all over again with open source security tools at a [Happy Hour Mixer](https://lu.ma/owasp-dublin-happyhour?utm_source=tldr), co-hosted with Jit, on Tuesday Feb 14 (Valentine's Day).

You can also check out our [Expert
Panel](https://get.semgrep.dev/londonpanel?utm_source=&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=Semgrep)
with some awesome folks who will be discussing scaling security programs and
running highly effective AppSec/ProdSec teams.

Hope to see you there!

> Corey: One post you had recently that I find myself in wholehearted agreement with is on the adoption of Tailscale in the enterprise. I use it for all of my personal nonsense and it is transformative. I like the idea of what that portends for a multi-cloud architecture. Historically one of the biggest problems in getting two clouds to speak to one another and manage them in an intelligent way is the security models are different, the user identity stuff is different as well, and the network stuff has always been nightmarish.
>
> Well, with Tailscale, you don‚Äôt have to worry about that in the same way at all. You can, more or less, ignore it, turn on host-based firewalls for everything and just allow Tailscale. And suddenly, okay, I don‚Äôt really have to think about this in the same way.

[How to Be 18 Years Old Again for Only $2 Million a Year](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2023-01-25/anti-aging-techniques-taken-to-extreme-by-bryan-johnson)<br/>
His routine is unbelievable.

> Bryan Johnson, 45, is an ultrawealthy software entrepreneur who has more than 30 doctors and health experts monitoring his every bodily function. The team, led by 29-year-old regenerative medicine physician Oliver Zolman, has committed to help reverse the aging process in every one of Johnson‚Äôs organs. Zolman and Johnson obsessively read the scientific literature on aging and longevity and use Johnson as a guinea pig for the most promising treatments, tracking the results every way they know how.
<br/><br/>

{% comment %}
> Each month, Johnson undergoes dozens of medical procedures, then tracks their effects on his body.

> his tests show that he‚Äôs reduced his overall biological age by at least five years. Their results suggest he has the heart of a 37-year-old, the skin of a 28-year-old and the lung capacity and fitness of an 18-year-old.

> Each morning starting at 5 a.m., Johnson takes two dozen supplements and medicines. There‚Äôs lycopene for artery and skin health; metformin to prevent bowel polyps; turmeric, black pepper and ginger root for liver enzymes and to reduce inflammation; zinc to supplement his vegan diet; and a microdose of lithium for, he says, brain health. Then there‚Äôs an hourlong workout, consisting of 25 different exercises, and a green juice packed with creatine, cocoa flavanols, collagen peptides and other goodies. Throughout the day, he eats some solid-ish health food (we‚Äôll get there), with the recipes tweaked based on the results of his latest tests. After eating, Johnson brushes, Waterpiks and flosses before rinsing with tea-tree oil and applying an antioxidant gel. His doctors say he has the gum inflammation of a 17-year-old.

> Daily, he measures his weight, body mass index and body fat, and he monitors his waking body temperature, blood glucose, heart-rate variations and oxygen levels while sleeping. He‚Äôs also undergoing a fairly constant stream of blood, stool and urine tests as well as whole-body MRIs and ultrasounds, plus regular tests aimed more specifically at his kidneys, prostate, thyroid and nervous system.

> To repair sun damage to his skin, Johnson applies seven daily creams and gets weekly acid peels and laser therapy, and he‚Äôs begun staying out of the sun. To improve hearing in his left ear (which suffered from childhood hunting trips in Utah), he does sound therapy, which tests the limits of the frequencies he can hear and then produces inaudible sounds that stimulate the cells in his ear and brain.

> Johnson prepared dinner for me, a sample of his typical fare. On the yum side, I was given something called nutty pudding, which consisted of almond milk, macadamia nuts, walnuts, flaxseed, half a Brazil nut, sunflower lecithin, cinnamon, cherries, blueberries, raspberries and pomegranate juice. Delicious. On the yuck side, I also had to eat a mound of vegetables that had been pureed into a gray-brown goop. Once upon a time, it consisted of black lentils, broccoli, cauliflower, mushrooms, garlic, ginger root, lime, cumin, apple cider vinegar, hemp seeds and olive oil, all of which sound fine on their own. But when put together and blended, it felt and tasted like dirt paste.

> For dessert, we had chocolate, but not just any chocolate. ‚ÄúWith Blueprint, there are layers,‚Äù Johnson said. ‚ÄúYou can say, ‚ÄòChocolate is good for you.‚Äô Then the next layer is ‚ÄòDark chocolate is better for you.‚Äô And then there is this Dutching process that people sometimes do to chocolate where they alkalize it to take away the bitterness, but it ruins much of the value. So, you want non-Dutched dark chocolate, and you want some that has been tested for heavy metals. And then you want chocolate from the regions of the world that have the highest concentration of polyphenols, which is what you‚Äôre trying to get. Unless you‚Äôre looking at that fifth layer of polyphenol concentration, you‚Äôre really getting very little benefit.‚Äù
